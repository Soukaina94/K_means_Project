The objectif behind this project is to apply the K-means machine learning method on our bristol bike data, in order to group bikes according to their locations.
along with this README, you can find the following files on our git repo named "K_means_Project":
data: a file containing  data we will be using in our project.
properties.conf: a file consisting of paths to our input and output data as well as some other information e.g: kmeans-partition
output: a file containing the result of our clustering under a csv format
code: it's a pyspark code generated on Jupiter notebook.
